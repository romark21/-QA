This repository collects some of the solutions to my technical assignments.


1. In the folder "Test (Accumulative Points)"
   Test task:
 The dispenser accepts accumulative discount cards and in its calculation takes into account the number of points, according to which it accrues a
percentage of discount:
From 0 to 100 points - 1% discount

that the customer will receive the correct discount according to his accumulated points.



2. In the folder "Калькулятор выручки от продажи квартир в небоскрёбе" there is a program that calculates the revenue from the sale of apartments in a skyscraper.
Task Conditions:
 A construction company has built a skyscraper with N floors, and wants to calculate how much revenue it can get from the
from the sale of all the apartments.

There is only one apartment on each floor.
The value of an apartment depends on which floor it is on.
The value of an apartment increases by $1,000 for every M floors.
The cost of the apartment on the first floor is X dollars.

For example: a building has 30 floors; the cost increases every 10 floors; the price of an apartment on the first floor is $10000.
In this case, apartments on floors 1 through 10 would cost $10000, on floors 11 through 20 would cost $11000,
 and floors 21 through 30 would cost $12,000.

You are given positive integers N, M, X.
Write a function that returns the amount the construction company can get from selling all the apartments.
The solution can be executed in any modern programming language. It is allowed to use pseudocode.
