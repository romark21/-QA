1.In the folder "Тест (Накопительные баллы)"

   Test task:
 The dispenser accepts accumulative discount cards and in its calculation takes into account the number of points, 
   according to which it accrues a
percentage of discount:
- From 0 to 100 points - 1% discount
- From 100 to 200 points - 3% discount
- From 200 to 500 points - 5% discount
- From 500 points - 10% discount

Task: Create such a set of test data for the automaton, in which we are guaranteed to know,
that the customer will receive the correct discount according to his accumulated points.

2.In the folder "Калькулятор выручки от продажи квартир в небоскрёбе" there is a program that calculates the revenue 
from the sale of apartments in a skyscraper.

Task Conditions:

 A construction company has built a skyscraper with N floors, and wants to calculate how much revenue it can get
from the sale of all the apartments.

- There is only one apartment on each floor.
- The value of an apartment depends on which floor it is on.
- The value of an apartment increases by $1,000 for every M floors.
- The cost of the apartment on the first floor is X dollars.

For example: 

a building has 30 floors; the cost increases every 10 floors; the price of an apartment on the first floor is $10000.
In this case, apartments on floors 1 through 10 would cost $10000, on floors 11 through 20 would cost $11000,
 and floors 21 through 30 would cost $12,000.

You are given positive integers N, M, X.
Write a function that returns the amount the construction company can get from selling all the apartments.
The solution can be executed in any modern programming language. It is allowed to use pseudocode.

3.In the folder "ТЗ Aston Задание_2" contains the program and the test are written using pytest

                                              Task 1:
  Write a program that takes as input two integers (a and b) and performs the following actions with them:
- compares these two numbers and returns the result of the comparison by outputting one of the options to the console:
"a > b", "a < b" or "a = b";

- performs addition, subtraction, division and multiplication operations with these numbers and outputs the result to the console.


                                              Task 2:
  Write a program that takes as input two strings (a and b) and compares them. As a result of the comparison in the
console should display one of the messages: "The strings are non-identical" or "The strings are identical".



                                            Task 3:
An array of integers is given: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. It is necessary to write a program that will print all the
even numbers.
