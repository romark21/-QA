In this folder contains the program and the test are written using pytest

                                             Task 1:
  Write a program that takes as input two integers (a and b) and performs the following actions with them:
- compares these two numbers and returns the result of the comparison by outputting one of the options to the console:
"a > b", "a < b" or "a = b";

- performs addition, subtraction, division and multiplication operations with these numbers and outputs the result to the console.


                                             Task 2:
  Write a program that takes as input two strings (a and b) and compares them. As a result of the comparison in the
console should display one of the messages: "The strings are non-identical" or "The strings are identical".



                                            Task 3:
An array of integers is given: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. It is necessary to write a program that will print all the
